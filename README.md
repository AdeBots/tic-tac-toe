# tic-tac-toe
## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the tic-tac-toe game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

index.html:

This file contains the HTML structure of the tic-tac-toe game. It includes the game board, which is typically a 3x3 grid, and any other necessary elements like buttons or messages.
style.css:

This file contains the CSS styles for the game. It defines the appearance of the game board, the cells, and any other visual elements. It ensures that the game looks appealing and is user-friendly.
script.js:

This file contains the JavaScript code that implements the game logic. It handles user interactions, such as clicking on a cell to make a move. It also checks for win conditions, updates the game state, and manages the flow of the game (e.g., switching turns between players).
Here's a high-level overview of how these files work together:

When the user opens index.html in a web browser, the HTML structure is loaded.
The browser then applies the styles defined in style.css to the HTML elements, making the game visually appealing.
The JavaScript code in script.js is executed, setting up event listeners for user interactions and managing the game logic.
This combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creates an interactive and visually appealing tic-tac-toe game that users can play directly in their web browser.
